Hello! Yes I do! I will send you an explanation for the questions, you tell me if they are clear and I can send you 10 questions :) Is that ok?



The questions are of this form:

{
    "question": "Waar kom je ___?",
    "options": [
        "van",
        "vandaar",
        "vandaan",
        "vandaag"
    ],
    "answer": -1
}

You read the question and just chose the best options to fill the blank. Then you replace the -1 in the answer line with a number from 1 to 4, signaling the option you chose. If that's clear, I'll send 10 of them through the chat. Thanks a lot for this!
